# AI-Society-PID-Controller

This is a PID controller lab for lateral control. You will code up a PID controller to perform lateral control of a simulated car moving at constant speed in a jupyter notebook, as well as learn how to implement a PID auto-tuning algorithm. The jupyter notebook is located in the root directory and is called ```PID-Controller.ipynb```.
