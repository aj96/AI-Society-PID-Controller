# PID-Controller

This is a PID controller lab for lateral control. You will code up a PID
controller to perform lateral control of a simulated car moving at constant
speed whose motion is governed by the bicycle kinematic model. You will also
learn how to implement a PID auto-tuning algorithm. The jupyter notebook is
located in the root directory and is called 
```PID-Controller.ipynb```.

Do all the TODO's in all of the code blocks.
